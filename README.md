# Privacy Policy for SupTwin
Last Updated: December 14, 2025

Appterra ("we," "our," or "us") operates the SupTwin mobile application (the "App"). We are based in Turkey and are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data with transparency.

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect
### A. Personal Information You Provide
Account Data: When you sign in with Google, we collect your name, email address, and profile picture.

Profile Details: Username, bio, gender, and birth date.

Location Data: We collect the Country and City that you manually select during onboarding. We do not collect precise GPS coordinates (e.g., your exact street address).

### B. Biometric and Face Data (Important)
To provide the core functionality of SupTwin (finding your "twin"), we utilize facial recognition technology.

What we collect: When you upload a photo, we analyze the facial features to create a mathematical representation of your face ("Face Geometry" or "Face ID").

How it is used: This data is used strictly to compare your features against our database of other users and celebrities to calculate a "Similarity Score."

Storage: The original photo is stored in our secure database. The Face ID is stored to facilitate matching.

Data Retention: We retain your photo and Face ID for as long as your account is active. When you delete your account, this data is permanently removed from our servers.

### C. Automatically Collected Data
Device Information: Device model, operating system, and general region (based on device language settings).

Usage Data: How you interact with the app, including purchase history and ad interactions.

## 2. How We Use Your Data
We use your data for the following purposes:

Twin Matching: To match you with other users or celebrities who look like you.

Service Delivery: To create your account and maintain your profile.

Communication: To send you notifications about new matches or chat messages.

Monetization: To process in-app purchases and display rewarded video ads.

## 3. Data Sharing and Third Parties
We do not sell your personal data. We share data only with the trusted third-party services required to run the App:

Supabase: For secure database hosting and authentication.

AWS (Amazon Web Services): For secure image storage (S3) and facial analysis (Rekognition).

Google (Firebase & AdMob): For authentication, notifications, and displaying advertisements.

RevenueCat: For processing subscriptions and in-app purchases.

## 4. Your Rights and Control
You have full control over your data:

Account Deletion: You can delete your account at any time directly within the App settings.

Effect of Deletion: When you request deletion, your profile, photos, Face ID, chat history, and personal information are permanently and immediately deleted from our active databases.

## 5. Security
We use industry-standard security measures (including encryption and secure tokens) to protect your data. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.

## 6. Children's Privacy
Our App is intended for users aged 13 and older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal data, we will take steps to delete such information immediately.

## 7. International Transfers & KVKK (Turkey)
SupTwin is operated from Turkey. Your information, including personal data, may be transferred to—and maintained on—computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ.

For Users in Turkey: We process your data in accordance with the Law on the Protection of Personal Data (KVKK).
